# Geek Hunters

You are working at IT-recruiting agency "Geek Hunters". Your employer asked you to implement Geek Registration System
(GRS). 

Using GRS a recruitment agent should be able to:
  - register a new candidate:
     - first name / last name
     - select technologies candidate has experience in from the predefined list 
  - view all candidates
  - filter candidates by technology

Another developer has partially designed and implemented a
SQLite DB for this project - GeekHunters.sqlite. Feel free to modify a structure to
your needs.

GRS is built using the following technology stack:
  - `ASP.NET Core` for the backend
  - `ASP.NET Core MVC` for API Controllers
  - `EntityFramework Core` for accessing the DB
  - `React.js` for the frontend

Good luck!

P.S: And unit tests! We love unit tests!
